# Multiverse Self Study Plan

## Technologies to focus on
- React
  - useContext hook
  - Other React 18 Hooks
- Jest 

## Overall Idea for Final Project
Create a project in React using Context (with useContext hook) for state management. Additionally, you could learn how to use Jest to specifically test your React frontend, as Jest comes prebuilt in the create-react-app. Additionally, think about trying to familiarize yourself with the new hooks of React 18.

## What am I using to study?
